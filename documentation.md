* **Sistemes autònoms de baix cost de suport a projectes educatius i de salut.**  
_By Albert Sànchez Fuster_.  
This TFG is intended to demonstrate the feasibility of doing an implementation of a medical
management software, in this case with an Open MRS distribution, through a 'Single-Board Computer' as a Raspberry Pi 3. In addition, an autonomous power system based on photovoltaic plates and batteries will be also dimensioned in order to provide energy to the Raspberry and facilitate its displacement.
